# GameTrafficOptimization 
The project is not finished yet.
Testing TCP, SCTP protocols, ROHC header compression, LZ4, Huffman payload compression with cocos2d-x. Made for masters thesis.

An application that supposed to work on different platforms.
Used for testing different algorithms:
Transport protofol header compression: ROHC
Payload that is mostly used in online games compression: LZ4, Huffman, Simd

And also to test couple of transport protocols:
TCP
SCTP

To do:
1. All the different libraries needs to be ported to different platforms. 
2. Prepare payload compression tests: cycles per time, compress ratio based on different game payload type.
3. SCTP tests ??
4. ROHC tests ??
